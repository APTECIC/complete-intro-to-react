  <p>Welcome to a complete intro to React! This course is designed to take from knowing nothing about React, Redux, or the tooling surrounding it to comfortable proficiency in all the above. This class does assume a basis in ES5-era JavaScript. The course does use ES6 but it's explained as it's used. These course materials were created for and funded by <a href="http://www.frontendmasters.com?ref=citr">Frontend Masters</a>. While these materials are and forever will be open source and free, please consider getting a membership with Frontend Masters; it's worth it!</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE: </strong> This is version 2 of this workshop that uses React v15, Jest, Webpack v2, React-Router v4, Yarn, and other technologies. If you are looking for v1 with Mocha, Sinon, Chai, React-Router v1, Webpack v1, and React v0.14, look <a href="https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v1/">here</a>.</p>
