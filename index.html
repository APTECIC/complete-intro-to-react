   <p>If you are here from <a href="https://frontendmasters.com">Frontend Masters</a>, you need to choose the one that corresponds to the video you're watching. Here's a guide based on what I look like:</p>

   <table>
     <thead>
       <tr>
         <td></td>
         <td>Day One</td>
         <td>Day Two</td>
       </tr>
     </thead>
     <tbody>
       <tr>
         <td>v1</td>
         <td><img src="images/v1-1.png" alt="shirt I was wearing during day one during v1"></td>
         <td><img src="images/v1-2.png" alt="shirt I was wearing during day two during v1"></td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>v2</td>
         <td><img src="images/v2-1.png" alt="shirt I was wearing during day one during v2"></td>
         <td><img src="images/v2-2.png" alt="shirt I was wearing during day one during v2"></td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
   </table>

   <p>Notice during the first day you can see the light-up Apple logo on my laptop whereas on the second time it was covered by a Netflix logo. If you can see the light-up album, follow the v1 version of the course. If you cannot see it, follow the v2 version.</p>

   <p>Otherwise, if you're not here from Frontend Masters and just want to follow the workshop materials, you <em>probably</em> want the v2 version; it's more updated with the latest tech. Below is the full break down of what they both cover.</p>
